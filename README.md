# Commute-Times
Calculating commute times to schools for many addresses using the Google Maps API (with traffic)

This document was used by the Cambridge Teacher's Union in salary negotiations to show the communtes of all teachers in the Cambridge Public Schools.
It showed the committee how long teahcers had to drive to reach work, with and without traffic at different times during the day, depending on when they had to reach their office

This code uses information from spreadsheets that was provided to the Union, but is not public information.
It uses teachers' home addresses, schools, and arrival/departure times to calculate how much time is spent commuting to/from school

This code is used in a spreadsheet that shows all of the teachers and all of their addresses/where they work. It then calculates their commute times depending on when they need to be at school and when they leave school.
It uses a the Google Maps API to calculate commute times when queried from a spreadsheet. It then puts this data into the spreadsheet that was used in negotiations.

The spreadsheet is unavailable due to privacy reasons.
